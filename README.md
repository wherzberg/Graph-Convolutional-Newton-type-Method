# Graph-Convolutional-Newton-type-Method
These are suplementary files for the manuscript "Graph Convolutional Networks for Model-Based Learning in Nonlinear Inverse Problems" by William Herzberg, Daniel B. Rowe, Andreas Hauptmann, and Sarah J. Hamilton. This manuscript can be found here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15138.

**main_functions.py**
This file contains functions that are imported and used in the other two files. Note that as they are, the functions `initializeDataset()` and `computeUpdates()` only use randomly simulated numbers as opposed to real data or methods to compute real updates.
